I need a name!
--------------

I guess until a name shows up, it will be "language" with a ".lang" extension

* Object Oriented
* Message Passing
* Prototypes
* Ruby-esque syntax as a base
* Influenced by: Ruby, Smalltalk, Self
* Live development as an Environment and as the default

Need a name that

* Isn't pretentious (e.g. Smalltalk)
* Doesn't have to fit the features of the language (Ruby, Perl, Python)
* Easy to remember
* Good mostly-unique file extension
* Domain available
* Twitter / Reddit available?

My interests

* Dune
* Foundation
* Golf
* Video games up the wazoo. The Witcher, WoW, Diablo, Mass Effect, etc.
* Invader Zim
* Fry and Laurie
* (can't do Monty Python =/)
* ...
* Can it be a theme? (Homebrew, Ruby and gems, Python and eggs, etc)
